### Hi there! üëã

I'm Johan Sebastian Caceres, a seventh-semester student at Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia, where I'm studying systems and computer engineering. I have a passion for technology and programming, and I thoroughly enjoy both learning and experimenting with new languages and tools. Collaborating with fellow developers and working in teams to craft innovative problem-solving solutions is something I find particularly rewarding. I'm excited about the continuous growth and learning opportunities in this field.

I bring experience working with languages like Python üêç, Java ‚òï, and JavaScript üåê. I've also gained proficiency in frameworks like Django, Angular, and Node with Nest. Additionally, I'm well-versed in libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn for performing tasks like regression, classification, and clustering. My coursework has covered various topics including data structures, computational infrastructure, object-oriented programming, databases, software development and cloud computing, networks, cybersecurity, IoT, and machine learning.

Currently, I'm enrolled in courses focusing on the development of mobile applications with Kotlin, forensic computation, cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things.
