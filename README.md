### Hi there 👋
I'm Johan Sebastian Caceres, a sixth-semester student from the Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia, where I study systems and computer engineering. I love technology and programming, and enjoy learning and experimenting with new languages and tools. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and working in teams to find creative solutions to problems. I'm excited to continue growing and learning in this field.

I have experience working with languages such as Python 🐍, Java ☕, and JavaScript 🌐, and have also worked with frameworks such as Django and Angular. I've taken courses in data structures, computational infrastructure, Object-oriented programming, databases, software development and cloud.

Currently, I'm watching courses on development with Node.js 🚀, machine learning 🤖, network communications infrastructure 📡, and optimization with programs like GAMS and Pyomo 📈. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies.

I'm also very interested in the fascinating world of cybersecurity 🔒. I've already studied basic concepts such as authentication 🔑, integrity 🔐, and availability 🕒, and have hands-on experience with hashes, keys, Diffie-Hellman algorithm and learned effective tactics to prevent and mitigate different kind of vulnerabilities like DDoS attacks.

I believe that my skills and experience make me a valuable contributor to any team, and I'm excited to take on new challenges and opportunities in this field!
