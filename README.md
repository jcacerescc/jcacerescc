### Hi there 👋
I'm Johan Sebastian Caceres, a seventh-semester student from the Universidad de Los Andes, Colombia, where I study systems and computer engineering. I love technology and programming, and enjoy learning and experimenting with new languages and tools. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and working in teams to find creative solutions to problems. I'm excited to continue growing and learning in this field.

I have experience working with languages such as Python 🐍, Java ☕, and JavaScript 🌐, and have also worked with frameworks such as Django, Angular and Node with Nest. I've taken courses in data structures, computational infrastructure, Object-oriented programming, databases, software development and cloud, networks, cibersecurity, IOT and machine learning.

Currently, I'm watching courses on development of mobile applications with kotlin, forensic computation, cibersecurity and Internet of everything.
